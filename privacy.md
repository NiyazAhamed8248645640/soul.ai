# Privacy & Consent (prototype copy — review with legal counsel)

Important: This is an example consent and privacy text for the SOS Relay prototype. You must have this reviewed by a qualified lawyer in the jurisdictions where you operate before using with real users.

Summary
- The SOS Relay app may (with your explicit opt-in) listen for an enrolled voice phrase. When triggered, it may automatically:
  - Capture a short video snapshot from front and rear cameras (up to configured seconds).
  - Capture a short audio snippet.
  - Capture the device location (GPS).
  - Encrypt the captured data on-device and upload to a secure server.
  - Notify trusted contacts and, with prior agreements, emergency services.

User controls
- You may enable/disable any of: audio capture, camera capture, location capture.
- You may enroll a voice passphrase and re-record it; enrollment helps reduce false positives.
- You may view and delete stored events from your account (subject to retention policy).

Retention & access
- Default retention is 30 days for uploaded evidence unless extended by a legitimate request authorized under local policies.
- Only authorized staff with two-factor access can view evidence. Evidence is encrypted in transit and at rest.

Legal & safety
- Local laws on recording vary. Some jurisdictions require all-party consent to audio recording. You must not deploy this app for non-consenting people.
- We recommend closed pilots only with consenting participants and legal oversight.
